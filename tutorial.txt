How to Locate the Current Chrome Profile Folder
1.  Click and drag the text below into the Chrome title bar above to open a new tab containing Chrome version information:

chrome://version/

2.  Copy the value of the Profile Path displayed on that page.

On Ubuntu, it looks something like this:

/home/username/.config/google-chrome/profileName

3.  Navigate to the profile path copied in the previous step.

On Windows, paste the path directly into the address bar of File Explorer and hit Enter.

On a Mac, select Go in the Finder menu, then click Go to Folder. Paste the path into the textbox and click Go.

On Ubuntu, select Go in the Files app menu, then click Enter Location. Paste the path into the textbox and hit Enter.
